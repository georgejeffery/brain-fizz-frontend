# Brain Fizz

An attempt to build a very annoying reminders and notes app. Built around the idea that repetitious reminders of tasks are most effective.

Uses Twilio API to send SMS's at regular daily intervals via cron jobs. Also implements a connection with IBM Watson Tone analyser for visual clues to emotional tone, as well as some bullet-journal style tracking features.

### Things to add if it was to go to production:

* Ability to enter own tag choice
* Choice between Whatsapp and SMS tag integration
* ?
